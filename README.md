# Humidity
Vapor sensor mesurement with 1ms sample time in any pressure ( from vaccum to high pressure )

The schematics must be remade because some bad mesurement, ie the aluminium particles
are considerated humidity. 
Thinking tu use ESP32 Wroom as controler for sensor, and may be without can bus.
